Global minimum and global maximum

* What is global minimum and global maximum?
Global minimum is an absolute minimum, is the smallest
overall value of a set, function, etc., over its entire range.

* What is local minimum and local maximum?
Min(or max) in a range.

=== Variance ===

In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared
deviation of a random variable from its mean, and it informally measures how
far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their mean.

=== Discrete vs continuous ===
Discrete variables are countable in a finite amount of time. For example, you
can count the change in your pocket. You can count the money in your bank account.
You could also count the amount of money in everyone’s bank account. It might
take you a long time to count that last item, but the point is — it’s still countable.
E.g. Colors= Green, Yellow, Red. Or Grade=A,B,C

Continuous Variables would (literally) take forever to count. In fact, you would
get to “forever” and never finish counting them. For example, take age.
You can’t count “age”. Why not? Because it would literally take forever.

=== Matrices and ML ===

Geometrically matrices represent row (or column) vectors. Vectors are special kind
'line' (connecting two points), it has direction and magnitude (length).

In Machine Learning, matrices are important. The data is actually represented as
matrix, you can think of row vectors. Where row is single data, with column as
features. And hence its R_d dimension plane/coordinate system.

In geometry a HYPERPLANE is a subspace of one dimension less than its ambient
space. If a space is 3-dimensional then its hyperplanes are the 2-dimensional planes, while if the space is 2-dimensional, its hyperplanes are the 1-dimensional lines.
