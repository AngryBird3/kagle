=== Variance ===

In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared
deviation of a random variable from its mean, and it informally measures how
far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their mean.

=== Discrete vs continuous ===
Discrete variables are countable in a finite amount of time. For example, you
can count the change in your pocket. You can count the money in your bank account.
You could also count the amount of money in everyone’s bank account. It might
take you a long time to count that last item, but the point is — it’s still countable.
E.g. Colors= Green, Yellow, Red. Or Grade=A,B,C

Continuous Variables would (literally) take forever to count. In fact, you would
get to “forever” and never finish counting them. For example, take age.
You can’t count “age”. Why not? Because it would literally take forever.
