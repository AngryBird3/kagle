=== Probability 101 ===

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B if A has occurred)
         = P(B) * P(A if B has occurred)

If A and B are independent events ..
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

P(A or B or both) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

If A and B are mutually exclusive events:
P(A or B or both) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)


==== Probability density function ====
It is also called distribution function of x or loosely the distribution of x.

It tells us: the probability that a random observation x will fall in any interval
a to b.. (as opposed to taking any one value)

                    b
P(a < x <= b) = integration f(x)dx
                    a

One can draw probability distribution of a variable using histogram. Histogram
could be using relative frequency in data set. (so called frequency distribution)

==== Cumulative Distribution Function ====
CDF
